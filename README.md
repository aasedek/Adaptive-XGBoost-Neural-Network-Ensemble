Adaptive XGBoost-Neural Network Ensemble
with Dynamic Meta-Learning for Enhanced
Predictive Modeling

This repo introduces a novel adaptive ensemble framework
that synergistically combines XGBoost and neural networks through
sophisticated meta-learning. The proposed method leverages advanced
uncertainty quantification techniques and feature importance integra-
tion to dynamically orchestrate model selection and combination. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate superior predictive performance and
enhanced interpretability across diverse datasets, contributing to the
development of more intelligent and flexible machine learning systems.
